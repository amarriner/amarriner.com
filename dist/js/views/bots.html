   <p>Since I don't have a lot of free time for larger projects these days, I find that small focused ideas are a good way 
to learn and stay sharp (or sharp-ish, anyway). One of my favorite things to work on is automated scripts that post 
things to <a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter</a>.</p>

    <p>Some of the most interesting bots that other people make are ones that seem like they're written by humans. I don't 
have a lot of experience in natural language processing so my bots generally don't do this. If they do they usually 
run on a series of templates.</p>

<p>You can see a full <a href="https://twitter.com/amarriner/lists/my-bots">list of my bots</a> on Twitter, and I'll list a few of 
my favorites below. The <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23botALLY&amp;src=typd">#botALLY hashtag</a> and the <a href="https://twitter.com/botALLY">@botALLY 
account</a> are good ways to discover twitter bots made by others.</p>

<p>This bot takes google walking directions as input and steps through them one at a time. Each time it tweets it posts 
google streetview images of the location as well as two maps (one zoomed, one further out). As of this writing it's 
walking from New York City to Los Angeles.</p>

<h4 id="janeaustenhaikuhttpstwittercomjaneaustenhaiku"><a href="https://twitter.com/JaneAustenHaiku">@JaneAustenHaiku</a></h4>

<p>This bot concatenates Jane Austen's Emma", "Pride and Predjudice" and "Sense and Sensibility" together and then 
runs through that entire text looking for series of words that fall into the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku">haiku</a> patterns. The sentences don't have to be sequential, in fact almost 
always they're not. Nor are they full sentences usually.</p>

<p>This is one of my better "more natural looking" language bots. Inspired by the work done <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/how-netflix-reverse-engineered-hollywood/282679/">parsing Netflix 
genres</a>, I 
thought it would be fun to scrape <a href="http://pandora.com">Pandora</a> for the data they use to classify songs. I wrote a 
spider that would grab a random song, cache its features and then move on to another related song and repeat over 
and over. So I now have a corpus of features I can pick from at random to assemble a tweet from. The idea, then is 
to do a "review" on this fictional song which ends up being just whether the bot "likes" or "doesn't like" the song. 
In order to give some context I whipped up a random band and song name generator. While that wasn't the original 
focus of the project, I ended up really liking the results of that.</p>
